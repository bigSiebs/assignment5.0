    <h2>Get Creative!</h2>
    <p>The Old North End is a cultural and artistic center in Burlington. A rich source of inspiration for artistic projects, the neighborhood contains many organizations and events that allow residents and visitors to make art and express their creativity.</p>
    <p>To name a few, there's the North End Studio, which offers events and classes featuring music, dance, and yoga. There's also the Off Center for the Dramatic Arts, which provides performance and rehearsal space for local and educational theatre productions.</p>
    <p>Then there's the Ramble, an annual event that began with a simple concept: "If we said 'anything goes,' the Old North End would shine in all of its creativity, energy, diversity." It's a community-driven event that's happened every summer going back to 2004, and itâ€™s unlike anything you've seen before. Check it out below.</p>
