    <h2>Have Fun!</h2>
    <p>In the Old North End, there are several places to get out and be active.</p>
    <h3>Roosevelt Park</h3>
    <p>On Oak Street, next the Burlington Boys & Girls Club, there's Roosevelt Park, which comprises an impressive athletic complex. The facilities include two tennis courts, two basketball courts, and a youth baseball field, with a batting net. If none of these sports appeal to you, the outfield of the baseball field doubles as an open space that's put to other uses when games aren't being played. On a given night, you might find a group there playing ultimate frisbee or soccer. It's a great place to break free after a long day.</p>    <figure class="fig-large">

    <h3>Burlington Bike Path</h3>
    <p>You can also run or bike on the bike path. Burlington has an extensive network of bike paths, and the ONE includes its own section of path. It will let you tour the more "rural" side of the neighborhood and, if you're from another part of town, it eventually connects to the other parts of the bike path that lead back to downtown and the New North End, so you can get back home that way. The ONE's bike path has some especially impressive views, as evidenced below!</p>

    <h3>Old Spokes Home</h3>
    <p>If you're interested in taking a spin on the bike path, but you don’t have a bike, or your bike is in need of a tune-up, you can stop in <a href="http://www.oldspokeshome.com/" target="_blank">Old Spokes Home</a>. The shop describes itself as an "alternative bike shop experience" that prides itself on selling tried-and-true parts and equipment and providing service that will help you achieve the "cycling adventure of your dreams," all at affordable prices. Even if you’re not interested in purchasing a bike or parts, stop in the shop to check out the owner’s impressive bicycle museum in the attic of the building. It includes many rare and historic rigs, and it's been featured in the <a href="http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/money/2014/09/04/shop-owner-bikes-change-lives/15038201/" target="_blank">Burlington Free Press</a>, and on the <a href="http://lovelybike.blogspot.com/2012/10/magic-in-vermont-old-spokes-home.html" target="_blank">Lovely Bicycle</a> and <a href="http://biciak.blogspot.com/2014/06/glenn-eames-old-spokes-home-in.html" target="_blank">Bici AK weblogs.</a></p>
    <h3>Little Park</h3>
    <p>Lastly, if you're just looking for some place to sit down and watch people, the ONE has a park for that, albeit a very small one. Little Park is named after George and Elaine Little, two advocates for park space in Burlington, and the name couldn't be more fitting. Little Park is a small triangle of land that includes a few benches and a great view of a populous street corner.</p>
