    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Grow ONE is the organization behind this site. It's mission is to help the Old North End neighborhood in Burlington, VT, continue to grow and become a desirable part of town for people to visit. Over the past several years, businesses, restaurants, and housing has popped up in the area, but we feel that the word-of-mouth reputation of the neighborhood remains unfavorable. Grow ONE would like to help improve that reputation. We hope that the site will draw in residents, improving the reputation of the area, which will then make it more appealing to nonresidents.</p>
    <p>We've identified several priorities in promoting the area:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>encouraging recreation in the area</li>
        <li>highlighting the artistic culture of the neighborhood</li>
        <li>drawing consumers to local businesses</li>
        <li>encouraging residents to volunteer in the community</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our organization and website are just getting off the ground, and in the future, with the help of those in our community, we hope to expand our presence, in person and online, and provide information that will help spur growth and development in our neighborhood.</p>

        <p>Joe is a fledgling web developer based in Burlington. He's doing his best with this site, but what he really needs is information. Joe has a good handle on the technical side of the site, so he'll keep it up and running, but he needs content for the site to reach the masses. If you're an individual or organization with ties to the Old North End, and you have an idea of something to add to this site, head over to our <a href="../contact/contact.php">Contact</a> page and provide your information. We'd love to build connections in the area!</p>
